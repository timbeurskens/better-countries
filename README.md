# Better Countries
## What is this?
The Better Countries application creates a list of countries based on location preferences. It can be used to improve existing country selection forms by sorting it in a clear and useful way.

All data is acquired from the [geodata.org](http://geodata.org/) API.

## Live Demo
A working demo can be found [here](https://better-countries.herokuapp.com).
